The reason why hosting companies provide multiple nameservers is to improve your global reach and create redundancy in case one of those nameservers goes down.\n\nWith Cloudflare, two nameservers are enough because we also propagate your DNS records to all of our data centers worldwide.\n\n**Note:** Only the two Cloudflare nameservers can be used.
