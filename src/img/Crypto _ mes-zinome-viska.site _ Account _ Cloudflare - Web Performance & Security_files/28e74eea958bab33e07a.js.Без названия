If you connect to your site over HTTPS and the lock icon is not present, or has a yellow warning triangle on it, your site may contain references to HTTP assets ("mixed content").\n\nMixed content is often due to factors not under the website owner\'s control such as embedded third-party content or complex content management systems. By rewriting URLs from "http" to "https", Automatic HTTPS Rewrites simplifies the task of making your entire website available over HTTPS, helping to eliminate mixed content errors and ensuring that all data loaded by your website is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.\n\n#### Does Automatic HTTPS Rewrites fix all mixed content errors?\nNo. Only URLs that are known to support HTTPS will be rewritten. We use data from EFF\'s HTTPS Everywhere and Chrome\'s HSTS preload list, among others, to identify which domains support HTTPS. If your zone is not on one of these lists, only active content will be rewritten. Passive content (such as images) will not be rewritten and will still cause mixed content errors.',"automatic_https_rewrites.title":"Automatic HTTPS Rewrites","crypto.custom_hostnames.card.body":"Manage the hostnames and SSL certificates for third-parties that CNAME to your domain.","crypto.custom_hostnames.card.help_drawer":"#### What are Custom Hostnames?\nCustom hostnames are third party hostnames that CNAME to your domain in order to receive the performance and security benefits of Cloudflare. Before you can use this feature your account must be configured with assistance from Cloudflare. If you are not yet an Enterprise customer, please fill our the [Enterprise contact form](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/contact/) and someone will be in touch shortly. If you already are an Enterprise customer, please contact your Customer Success Manager.\n\n#### How do I add a custom hostname?\nOnce your account has been provisioned, you should type the hostname you wish to add (i.e., the one that has a CNAME to your domain) in the 'Hostname to add' input box, select a validation method—we recommend HTTP validation as it requires no interaction from the third party for SSL issuance other than adding the initial CNAME—and then click the 'Add Custom Hostname' button. Once you click the button, Cloudflare will attempt to issue an SSL certificate for the custom hostname according to the validation method selected; validation methods are described below in detail.\n\n#### Which validation methods are available for SSL issuance?\nThere are three validation methods available for use with custom hostnames: HTTP, email, and CNAME. HTTP validation is recommended as it requires no action for the owner of the custom hostname (other than initially pointing the CNAME). Email and CNAME validation can be used if you wish to have the SSL certificate issued and deployed to Cloudflare's edge before you instruct the owner of the custom hostname to add the CNAME record; typically this is only required if that hostname previously had HTTPS support and a downtime of a couple minutes (for the certificate issuance) is unacceptable. If you select email validation, an email will be sent to the WHOIS contacts on file for the zone in addition to the following addresses at the domain: admin, administrator, hostmaster, postmaster, and webmaster. The recipient will then need to click on the link and approve the certificate request. If you select CNAME validation, you will be provided with an additional CNAME to provide to the custom hostname owner for addition to their authoritative DNS provider.\n\n#### What does the refresh button do?\nThe refresh button can be used to request that Cloudflare check the status of the certificate issuance. Statuses transition automatically from Initializing to Pending Validation to Pending Issuance to Pending Deployment and then to Active.\n\n#### What happens if I exceed my custom hostname quota?\nIf you exceed your quota you will no longer be able to issue additional certificates. You will need to contact your Customer Success Manager to have this quota increased.\n\n#### How can I upload custom certificates?\nYou must use the API to upload custom certificates.

The average max-age is six months (you can set the max-age in the next step). **If you remove HTTPS before disabling HSTS your website will become inaccessible to visitors for up to the max-age or until you support HTTPS again.** Because disabling HTTPS on an HSTS enabled website can have these consequences, we strongly suggest that you have a committed HTTPS service in place before enabling this feature.\n\n[More information](https://blog.cloudflare.com/enforce-web-policy-with-hypertext-strict-transport-security-hsts/)","hsts.configuration.step1.title":"Acknowledgement","hsts.configuration.step2.description":"**Caution**: If misconfigured, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) can make your website inaccessible to users for an extended period of time.","hsts.configuration.step2.title":"Configure","hsts.configuration.title":"Configure HSTS","hsts.configuration.warning.confirm":"I understand","hsts.description":"Enforce web security policy for your website.","hsts.help":'##### What is HTTP Strict Transport Security?\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS, RFC 6797) is a header which allows a website to specify and enforce security policy in client web browsers. This policy enforcement protects secure websites from downgrade attacks, SSL stripping, and cookie hijacking. It allows a web server to declare a policy that browsers will only connect using secure HTTPS connections, and ensures end users do not "click through" critical security warnings. HSTS is an important security mechanism for high security websites. HSTS headers are only respected when served over HTTPS connections, not HTTP.\n\nHSTS generally has the following behavior in user web browsers:\n\n- Insecure HTTP links become secure HTTPS links\n- SSL certificate warnings or other errors show an error message and cannot be bypassed by the user\n\n#### Considerations\n\nOne critical consideration when using HSTS on Cloudflare is that once HSTS is turned on, your website must continue to have a valid HTTPS configuration conforming with the HSTS header to avoid making the website inaccessible to users. If SSL is disabled through other means ("grey clouding" a Flexible SSL website, or moving a website off Cloudflare), it is possible the website will be inaccessible to users for the duration of cached max-age headers, or until HTTPS is re-established and an HSTS header with value 0 is served. Consequently, HSTS configuration requires reading and acknowledging understanding of a warning message.\n\n#### Max-Age Header\n\nHSTS includes a "max-age" parameter which specifies the duration HSTS will continue to be cached and enforced by the web browser. This parameter generally is set at 6 months by default, however you must use a minimum of 12 months if you wish to be included in the HSTS Preload list (see below). The special value of "0" means HSTS is disabled and will no longer be cached by the client web browser. For the amount of time specified in the max-age header after a website is successfully accessed over HTTPS, the browser will enforce this HSTS policy, requiring HTTPS with correctly-configured certificates.\n\n#### Including Subdomains with HSTS\n\nCloudflare supports the "includeSubDomains" parameter in HSTS headers. This parameter applies the HSTS policy from a parent domain (such as example.com) to subdomains (such as www.development.example.com or api.example.com). Caution is encouraged with this header, as if any subdomains do not work with HTTPS they will become inaccessible.\n\n#### HSTS Preload\n\nCloudflare supports HSTS preload. This flag signals to web browsers that a website\'s HSTS configuration is eligible for preloading, that is, inclusion into the browser\'s core configuration. Without preload, HSTS is only set after an initial successful HTTPS request, and thus if an attacker can intercept and downgrade that first request, HSTS can be bypassed. With preload, this attack is prevented.\n\nOnce HSTS is configured, you must visit each browser\'s preload submission URL manually.

Certificate", HTTPS is not yet available for your site because Cloudflare does not have a certificate for it. Provisioning typically takes around 15 minutes for paid plans and up to 24 hours for Free. Contact Support if you do not have a certificate after that time.\nIf the status above shows "Active Certificate" there are [several other common problems that can appear](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170566-Why-isn-t-SSL-working-for-my-site-) when accessing your site over HTTPS.\n\n#### What SSL setting should I use?\nThis setting controls [how Cloudflare\'s servers connect to your origin for HTTPS requests](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170416). We recommend enabling the Full SSL (Strict) setting if possible. Common use cases for each are:\n\n**Off:** No visitors will be able to view your site over HTTPS; they will be redirected to HTTP.\n\n**Flexible SSL:** You cannot configure HTTPS support on your origin, even with a certificate that is not valid for your site. Visitors will be able to access your site over HTTPS, but connections to your origin will be made over HTTP. Note: You may [encounter a redirect loop with some origin configurations](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000219871).\n\n**Full SSL:** Your origin supports HTTPS, but the certificate installed does not match your domain or is self-signed. Cloudflare will connect to your origin over HTTPS, but will not validate the certificate.\n\n**Full (strict):** Your origin has a valid certificate (not expired and signed by a trusted CA or Cloudflare Origin CA) installed. Cloudflare will connect over HTTPS and verify the cert on each request.\n',"ssl.status.action_needed":"Action Needed","ssl.status.active":"Active Certificate","ssl.status.authorizing":"Authorizing Certificate","ssl.status.expired":"Expired Certificate","ssl.status.initializing":"Initializing Certificate","ssl.status.issuing":"Issuing Certificate","ssl.status.not_eligible":"Ineligible for SSL","ssl.status.pending_deletion":"Pending Deletion","ssl.status.timing_out":"Certificate Timing Out","ssl.status.pending_validation":"Certificate Pending Validation","ssl.status.deleted":"Certificate Deleted","ssl.status.deletion_timed_out":"Certificate Issuance Timed Out (Deletion)","ssl.status.deployment_timed_out":"Certificate Issuance Timed Out (Deployment)","ssl.status.initializing_timed_out":"Certificate Issuance Timed Out (Initializing)","ssl.status.validation_timed_out":"Certificate Issuance Timed Out (Validation)","ssl.status.issuance_timed_out":"Certificate Issuance Timed Out","ssl.status.pending_deployment":"Certificate Pending Deployment","ssl.status.pending_expiration":"Certificate Pending Expiration","ssl.status.pending_issuance":"Certificate Pending Issuance","ssl.status.pending":"Certificate Pending","ssl.title":"SSL","ssl.status":"Universal SSL Status","tls_1_2_only.certificate_required_tooltip":"You must add a custom certificate first","tls_1_2_only.description":"Only use modern versions—1.2 and 1.3 (if enabled)—of the TLS protocol.

TLS 1.3 is the newest, fastest, and most secure version of the TLS protocol. TLS 1.2 is the version that immediately preceded 1.3 and is also considered secure. TLS is the protocol that encrypts communication between users and your website. When web traffic is encrypted with TLS, users will see the green padlock in their browser window.
