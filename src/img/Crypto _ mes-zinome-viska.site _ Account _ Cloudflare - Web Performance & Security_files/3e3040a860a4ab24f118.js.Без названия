Cloudflare then either responds from cache or fetches the answer from the upstream origins.\n#### What is a DNS Cluster?\nA DNS Cluster is a group of nameservers that contain the same data.  When Cloudflare receives a DNS query destined for one of the nameservers in that cluster, it chooses the most performant server within that cluster to fetch the answer from. \n#### How does the maximum and minimum cache TTL work?\nCloudflare’s DNS Firewall proxy cache respects the cache TTLs on DNS records within a maximum and minimum that you can configure per DNS cluster. The benefit of setting a high maximum TTL is to increase the cache hit ratio, improving the speed of your DNS answers and reducing the load your origin servers need to handle. However, a higher maximum TTL also means that you will need to wait extra time for DNS records to update when changes to them are made.\n#### What does it mean if ANY queries are turned off?\nANY queries are a built-in debugging tool, meant to return every DNS record that exist for a name. Unfortunately, they are instead more often used for launching large DDoS attacks. Cloudflare stopped answering ANY queries for its own DNS traffic in September 2015 and published [this Internet Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jabley-dnsop-refuse-any) to propose this as a wider solution. If you would like to deprecate ANY queries on your DNS traffic, then you can turn on ‘Deprecate ANY’ and Cloudflare will answer automatically to ANY with an HINFO record:\n\n`HINFO     "Please stop asking for ANY"  "See draft-ietf-dnsop-refuse-any"`',"virtual-dns.card.invalid_ip_address":"%{address} is not a valid IP Address","virtual-dns.card.ip-addresses":"IP Addresses","virtual-dns.card.maximum_cache_ttl":"Max.
